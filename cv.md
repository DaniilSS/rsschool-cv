### Summary

Let me introduce myself, my name is Daniel.

My goal is to become a highly qualified specialist in the field of website development.

I graduated from a music school, studied the accordion for 4 years. After that, I became interested in physics, but I got tired of it, and by the 10th grade, when programming began, I liked it. That's why I'm here now.

I have the slightest experience in web development, in the form of coursework at a university.

I want to start doing AI and neural networks, but now there is not enough time for this. I am also looking for a job in web development that I can combine with my university studies.
